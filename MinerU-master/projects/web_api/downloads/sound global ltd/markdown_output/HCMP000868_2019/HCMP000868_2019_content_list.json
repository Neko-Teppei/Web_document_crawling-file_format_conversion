The regulators in particular the SEHK may want to review the position and address the problem sooner than later. One possible avenue available to the regulators would be for the SEHK to require any person who assumes the position as director of a listed company to agree, as part of the undertaking he/she gives to the SEHK, to designate a place within the jurisdiction at which the regulators may serve the originating process on him/her when they take enforcement action against such director.
